# On-Premise

You can host it using the following flavors:

- [Docker](/docs/flavors/on-premise/docker)
- [Node](/docs/flavors/on-premise/node)
- [Pterodactyl Panel](/docs/flavors/on-premise/pterodactyl)

If you don't know the difference then we recommend sticking with [Docker](/docs/flavors/on-premise/docker).
